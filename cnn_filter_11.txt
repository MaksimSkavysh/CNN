WARNING:tensorflow:From /home/maksim/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tflearn/initializations.py:119: UniformUnitScaling.__init__ (from tensorflow.python.ops.init_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use tf.initializers.variance_scaling instead with distribution=uniform to get equivalent behavior.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /home/maksim/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tflearn/objectives.py:66: calling reduce_sum (from tensorflow.python.ops.math_ops) with keep_dims is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
keep_dims is deprecated, use keepdims instead
